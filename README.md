This game will be a hybrid between a tower-defense and FPS. The purpose is to provide the players with an engaging and immersive experience that combines strategic tower defense with FPS gameplay. The target audience are mobile gamers who enjoy strategy games. The game will cater to a variety of playstyles, from very active FPS gameplay to basically AFK.

- **Value/Use:** A clear and explicit explanation of the value or use provided by the application/game.

This game will provide an activity.
Optimally, one will be able to play this game using just one hand on a phone, providing great accessibility.

- **User Interaction and Experience:** A description of how users will interact with the application/game and what their experience will be like.

Players will be able to customize and design a "squad" of AI-controlled "units" to take into each level. These customizations will affect damage, HP, range, mobility, and other aspects of each unit.

During gameplay there are two types of phases: "command" & "action."
During the "command" phase, the player is taken out of first-person and given a birds-eye-view. The game is significantly slowed down to give the player a chance to survey each level in detail. This includes enemy pathing, the current stats of each unit, etc. Here, the player can give detailed commands to each of their unit, such as designating a new position to move to, identifying targets, etc. This phase lasts for a few seconds to encourage quick thinking. There will be a cooldown before the player can re-enter this phase.
During the "action" phase, the player returns to first-person and takes control of their unit. Visibility is reduced to the first-person. The player can still see some basic stats regarding their units (e.g. other units' hp) Basic commands, such as designating a target, can be issued. The player is able to participate in the action and move their unit around.

Victory is accomplished by successfully achieving an objective, be it defending a point or moving to capture one.

- **Competitive Element:** Details on how the application/game facilitates competition among students.

The primary form of competition would come from achieving the highest score on levels. Score can be calculated from how fast was the objective achieved, how much damage was taken, how much damage was dealt, etc...

PvP can be a potential feature. Two teams of players are deployed on opposite sides of a map with an objecive. Both simultaneously enter and exit a command phase. Afterwards, the units move according to the designated strategies until the next command phase. The first team to achieve their objective or defeat the opposing team wins.

- **Engagement and Addictiveness Strategies:** An explanation of the features or strategies employed to make the application/game engaging and addictive.

- **Scalability and Expansion:** A discussion of how the design allows for future growth and adoption beyond the initial homework assignment.

Levels can be regularly designed and added to the game.
There can be different game modes centered around different objectives.
New units can be added.

- **Accessibility and Inclusivity:** A section detailing how the design adheres to the California non-discrimination clause and ensures inclusivity for all potential users.

Customizable controls, appearances, and different viable strategies can ensure the game is inclusive to all potential users.
